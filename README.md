# Angle Measurement using MPU-6050
This repository contains code and resources for measuring angles using the MPU-6050 6DOF 3 Axis Gyro With Accelerometer Sensor Module.

## Introduction
The MPU-6050 is a popular sensor module that combines a 3-axis gyroscope and a 3-axis accelerometer into a single chip. 
It is commonly used in projects requiring motion sensing, orientation tracking, and gesture recognition. 
In this project, we utilize the MPU-6050 to measure angles based on the data from its gyroscope and accelerometer.

### Usage
This project provides a basic framework for measuring angles using the MPU-6050 sensor module.
You can further extend the functionality by integrating it into your own projects. Here are some potential use cases:

Robotics: Use angle measurements for controlling the orientation of robotic arms or vehicles.
Aerospace: Monitor the orientation of drones or other aerial vehicles.
Virtual Reality: Implement head tracking using angle measurements for immersive VR experiences.
Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your specific requirements.
